# CO2 Emission of Cars

This project is to predict the emission of CO2 from different cars having different configurations like:

  - Type of the Car
  - Engine Size
  - Type of Fuel
  - Car Class
  - Cylinders Size
  - Fuel Consumed in the City
  - Fuel Consumed on the Highway
  - Car's MPG
 
 
Inorder to predict the emission of CO2, the algorithm used is "Multi-Linear Regression"

A Flask application is integrated with the build model. So that the user can enter the inputs through the UI of the application.
